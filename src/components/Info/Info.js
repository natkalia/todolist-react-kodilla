    A task list (also called a to-do list or things-to-do) is a list of tasks to be completed, 
    such as chores or steps toward completing a project. It is an inventory tool which serves as 
    an alternative or supplement to memory.
    Task lists are used in self-management, business management, project management, and software
    development. It may involve more than one list.  
    When one of the items on a task list is accomplished, the task is checked or crossed off. 
    The traditional method is to write these on a piece of paper with a pen or pencil, 
    usually on a note pad or clip-board. 
    Task lists can also have the form of paper or software checklists.
